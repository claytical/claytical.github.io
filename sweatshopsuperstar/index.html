            <h2>A Rhythm Game with a Message</h2>
<p>Sweatshop Superstar is a rhythm-based action game that critiques the exploitative conditions of sweatshop labor. Developed in 2009, the game places players in a fast-paced, relentless factory environment where timing and precision are key to success. By embodying the experience of factory work, the game encourages players to reflect on the human cost behind consumer products, using interactive gameplay to foster empathy and raise awareness.</p>
<h3>Project Significance</h3>
<p>Creating Sweatshop Superstar was an exploration into how games could move beyond entertainment and become powerful tools for social commentary. At the time, ethical consumption and labor practices were starting to receive greater attention, and the game aimed to contribute to these conversations through an innovative, engaging platform.</p>
<h3>Challenges and Platform Barriers</h3>
<p>The game faced significant challenges during its release, including outright bans by the App Store due to its sensitive subject matter. This experience underscored the restrictive nature of platform curation and the barriers developers encounter when addressing complex or controversial social issues. Despite its strong thematic foundation, Sweatshop Superstar remained limited in its reach, playable only on an older iPhone 3GS in gallery exhibitions.</p>
<p>Ironically, in the same year, two other games that addressed sweatshop labor—Sweatshop HD and Phone Story—were developed independently and received considerable media attention. Unlike Sweatshop Superstar, these games found a broader audience, highlighting the unpredictable nature of which projects gain visibility and the role of platform policies in shaping public engagement with socially critical content.</p>
<h3>Reflections and Legacy</h3>
<p>While Sweatshop Superstar did not achieve widespread recognition, its development and release underscored important lessons about creative freedom, platform gatekeeping, and the challenges faced by developers tackling social issues. The game's journey serves as a reminder of the need for spaces that support diverse and critical perspectives in game development. It remains a testament to the power of games to provoke thought and drive conversations about ethics and social justice, even when constrained by distribution challenges.</p>
<h3>Thematic Connections</h3>
<h4>Ad Patrol</h4>
<p>Ad Patrol was a civic engagement project aimed at mapping and documenting illegal advertisements through user participation. My role in designing the system connects to Sweatshop Superstar’s goal of raising awareness about exploitative practices. Both projects emphasize user interaction to foster social awareness and critique. While Ad Patrol served as a proof of concept, it reinforced my focus on community-driven data collection and ethical issues.</p>
<h4>ROC United Diners Guide</h4>
<p>My work on the Diners Guide involved designing an app that educated users on ethical dining practices, connecting with Sweatshop Superstar’s theme of social responsibility. Both projects demonstrate my dedication to creating technology that seeks to empower users to make conscientious choices. The Diners Guide received significant downloads and positive media coverage, showing the reach and impact of well-designed educational apps.</p>
