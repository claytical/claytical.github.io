            <h2>Navigating Health, Choice, and Advocacy Through Gameplay</h2>
<p>Unsavory is a mobile game that immerses players in the complex reality of balancing personal health, public safety, and financial well-being. Designed to foster empathy and raise awareness, the game addresses the challenges faced by restaurant workers, presenting these issues as part of a larger systemic narrative. The gameplay includes an integrated social media campaign that prompts players to share important information about healthcare access and paid sick leave.</p>
<h3>Project Significance</h3>
<p>The concept for Unsavory grew from my work with ROC United, leading me to design a game that combined activism with interactive storytelling. Supported by a School of Communication Creative Award, I led the project as both the primary programmer and designer, working alongside three graduate students and a local composer. This collaborative process highlighted the value of mentoring and demonstrated that student contributions can result in high-quality, impactful work.</p>
<p>The game received recognition within the serious games community, earning awards such as the Gold Award at the International Serious Play Awards and a special emphasis award at the Serious Games Showcase and Challenge. It was also recognized as the Best of Category in Mobile Games at the Horizon Interactive Awards. These accolades underscored the innovative integration of gameplay with real-world advocacy.</p>
<h3>Development and Challenges</h3>
<p>Leading the development of Unsavory meant ensuring that gameplay mechanics effectively communicated the gameâ€™s core messages. The experience of guiding a student team required strategic mentorship, allowing for skill growth and team cohesion. A key feature was the integration of social media elements, empowering players to advocate beyond the game itself.</p>
<h3>Recognition and Academic Outreach</h3>
<p>Unsavory was showcased at respected conferences and exhibitions, including Games+Learning+Society 12 and Meaningful Play, which facilitated discussions on the role of games in education and social activism. At the University of Miami, the game was featured in workshops on narrative techniques, where it served as an example of using interactive media for impactful storytelling.</p>
<h3>Press and Community Engagement</h3>
<p>The game garnered attention from various media outlets, such as Eater Miami and the Seattle Times, which highlighted its innovative approach to raising awareness about labor rights and healthcare. This media coverage reinforced the significance of Unsavory as a tool for sparking dialogue around public health and working conditions.</p>
<h3>The 2020 Update</h3>
<p>In 2020, prompted by both Apple and Google Play mandate requiring code updates, I revisited Unsavory with a new perspective. This update incorporated real-time elements reflecting the COVID-19 pandemic, adding a feature where players could see genuine news headlines, tweets, presidential declarations, and government press releases. The update aimed to capture the chaotic information ecosystem and convey the lived experiences of front-line workers during a time of significant political and public health turbulence.</p>
<p>Despite this creative expansion, Apple's App Store rejected the update, citing its use of the term &quot;pandemic.&quot; Even after attempts to rename and adjust the content, further development was blocked. This experience highlighted the limitations imposed by major platform policies and raised questions about their impact on creative expression and historical documentation.</p>
<p>Unsavory remains a testament to the power of games to highlight complex social issues, promote empathy, and advocate for systemic change. It continues to engage players and provoke thought about the challenges faced by workers and public health policies.</p>
<h3>Thematic Connections</h3>
<h4>Personal Exposure Reporter</h4>
<p>I served as the lead of a subproject for the Firefighter Cancer Initiative to track firefighter health risks, sharing Unsavoryâ€™s focus on public health and awareness. Both projects emphasize interactive solutions for educating and fostering empathy, with the Personal Exposure Reporter being adopted by fire departments across the United States and Unsavory receiving accolades for its innovative design.</p>
<h4>SCAN 360</h4>
<p>Co-developing SCAN 360 involved creating a platform to visualize cancer data, connecting with Unsavoryâ€™s mission to inform users about health-related issues. The tool was recognized for its potential to impact research and public health.</p>
<h4>ROC United Diners Guide to Ethical Eating</h4>
<p>Designing the interactive version of the Diners Guide involved creating an app that empowered users to make ethical dining choices. Working on this project was the impetus for Unsavory, taking a playful perspective on the goal of raising awareness about worker conditions. Both projects received positive feedback and awards, showcasing my ability to create interactive technology that promote ethical decision-making.</p>
