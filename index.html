I teach at the <a href="http://com.miami.edu" target="_blank">University of Miami</a> in the <a href="http://interactive.miami.edu" target="_blank">Interactive Media Program</a>. I'm the Director of <a href="http://nerdlab.miami" target="_blank">NERDLab</a>, where I work with students, researchers and creative professionals to design and develop social impact games and applications. My work has received numerous awards from organizations such as the Serious Games Showcase, International Serious Play Awards, Broadcast Education Association (BEA), Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC) and the Appys. The games I've worked on have been exhibited at awesome conferences and festivals such as IndieCade, Meaningful Play, the International Symposium on Electronic Art (ISEA) and Come Out and Play.</p>          <p class="title mt-5">What's the latest?</p>                        <p>I'm an advocate for open technology. While access to technology is not equal, I pride myself on making as much of my work freely available both in terms of content and code. I have recently started podcasting about the internet. The first series, <a href="#knowyournet">Know Your Net</a> is an adaptation of a class I teach called Internet, Media and Society.</p>            <p>I recently finished a pandemic edition of <a href="#unsavory">Unsavory</a>, to take a deeper look at the government response and the life of a restaurant worker deemed essential. It's available <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.nerdlab.miami">here</a>. It will not be available for iOS as the beta was rejected by Apple as inappropriate (according to Apple, games are for entertainment only).</p>            <p>I have a deep interest in creating high quality evidence-based games. While there is an exuberance for using technology to solve a variety of problems, I'd prefer that each solution can be proven effective. If you attended Games for Change in 2018, you may have seen my talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8Q4WnkF3A8" target="_blank">Hypothesis Tested: Designing Social Impact Games with Theoretical Frameworks</a> where I discuss the design, development and evaluation of <a href="#dreamy">Dreamy</a>, an online dating simulator that seeks to change the player's intention to tan. Based on the initial findings, we're using what we learned to tackle anxiety and depression in college students.</p>        </div>        <div id="unsavory" class="detail" style="display:none;">          <div class="tile is-ancestor">            <div class="tile is-parent">              <article class="tile is-child box">                <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Unsavory</p>                                    <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Play It</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fab fa-app-store"></i> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unsavory/id959296519?mt=8">Get it on the App Store</a></li>                      <li><i class="fab fa-google-play"></i> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dataplayed.unsavory&hl=en_US">Get it on Google Play</a></li>                                        </ul>                    <!--                    <p class="title">Articles</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="far fa-newspaper"></i> <a href="https://news.miami.edu/stories/2015/05/nerdlab-game-is-unsavory.html">NERDLab Game is Unsavory</a></li>                      <li><i class="far fa-newspaper"></i> <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/education/article31348037.html">In South Florida, rethinking the computer game as a teaching tool</a></li>                      <li><i class="far fa-newspaper"></i> <a href="https://miami.eater.com/2015/4/28/8509535/miami-created-video-game-shows-what-it-is-like-to-work-in-the">Miami Created Video Game Shows What It Is Like To Work in the Restaurant Industry While Sick</a></li>                    </ul>                                        -->                    <p class="title">Awards</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Gold, International Serious Play Awards</li>                      <li><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Best Mobile Game, Horizon Interactive Awards</li>                      <li><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> GLS 12 Finalist</li>                      <li><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Serious Games Showcase and Challenge</li>                    </ul>                    <p class="title">Exhibitions</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i> GLS 12 Games Arcade</li>                      <li><i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i> Meaningful Play 2016</li>                      <li><i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i> ISEA 2016</li>                    </ul>                  </div>                </div>              </article>            </div>            <div class="tile is-vertical is-8">              <div class="tile">                                <div class="tile is-parent">                  <article class="tile is-child">                      <iframe width="100%" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkewS_aob0A?rel=0&modestbranding=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>                  </article>                </div>              </div>              <div class="tile is-parent">                <article class="tile is-child">                  <div class="content">                  <p>Unsavory is a mobile game designed to put the player in the precarious position of choosing between their personal health, public health and their financial well-being. Like other activist games, the intention is to create awareness and empathy around an issue that is best understood as part of a larger system. Additionally, the game seeks to be a catalyst for change by embedding a social media campaign into gameplay that encourages players to share meaningful facts and statistics regarding restaurant workers, access to health care, and paid sick day legislation.</p>                                  <p>My work with ROC United put me on the path to design Unsavory. With funding through a School of Communication Creative Award, I assembled a team of three graduate students and a local composer to develop the game. Unsavory was extremely well received by the serious games community. It was accepted into numerous peer reviewed and juried exhibitions, including Meaningful Play and Games+Learning+Society 12 where it was among the top 5 games in the showcase. Unsavory also received a gold award at the International Serious Play Awards in the main competition, even though the majority of the team was comprised of students. For its innovative use of social media, the game also received a special emphasis award at the Serious Games Showcase and Challenge, which is part of I/ITSEC, the largest training and simulation conference in the world. Additionally, the game won the Best of Category in Mobile Games at the 2015 Horizon Interactive Awards.</p>                  <p>Advocating for social issues through games was new territory for University of Miami. I was invited by Academic Technologies to talk faculty and staff about the game as part of a workshop on narrative techniques and the game is part of their examples for simulations.                      Unsavory received a healthy amount of press coverage, including Eater Miami and the Seattle Times. At the university, it was a featured article on UM News and E-Veritas. It was also mentioned in various press releases for award shows.</p>                  </div>                </article>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>        <div id="unsavory2020" class="detail" style="display:none;">          <div class="tile is-ancestor">            <div class="tile is-parent">              <article class="tile is-child box">                <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Unsavory: Pandemic Edition</p>                                    <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Play It</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fab fa-google-play"></i> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.nerdlab.miami&hl=en_US&gl=US">Get it on Google Play</a></li>                                        </ul><!--                    <p class="title">Awards</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Gold, International Serious Play Awards</li>                      <li><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Best Mobile Game, Horizon Interactive Awards</li>                      <li><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> GLS 12 Finalist</li>                      <li><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Serious Games Showcase and Challenge</li>                    </ul>                    <p class="title">Exhibitions</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i> GLS 12 Games Arcade</li>                      <li><i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i> Meaningful Play 2016</li>                      <li><i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i> ISEA 2016</li>                    </ul>-->                  </div>                </div>              </article>            </div>            <div class="tile is-vertical is-8">              <div class="tile">                                <div class="tile is-parent">                  <article class="tile is-child">                      <iframe width="100%" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eLKrmUislUo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>                  </article>                </div>              </div>              <div class="tile is-parent">                <article class="tile is-child">                  <div class="content">                  <p>In the year 2020, to say that life in the United States was upended by a global pandemic is a bit of an understatement. Everyone dealt with challenges in their own way. Living in the middle of a crisis, news and events get blurred together. As a designer, I wanted to use this opportunity to look at the life of a low wage worker in tandem with the timeline of the pandemic.                  </p>                  <p>To do this, I repurposed my game Unsavory, originally released in 2013. For the new release, you continually receive letters from 4 sources: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an aggregation of mainstream media outlets, Donald Trump, and your employer. This creates a timeline of where the United States was at in terms of dealing with the pandemic of 2020.</p>                  <p>It’s an exploration and documentation of a great time of uncertainty. I see this game as bit of a historical record and I hope that years from now, people will be able to play it and reflect on what a challenging and shitty time it was when our government completely failed us.</p>                  </div>                </article>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>        <div id="squawker" class="detail" style="display:none;">          <div class="tile is-ancestor">            <div class="tile is-parent">              <article class="tile is-child box">                <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Squawker</p>                                    <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Play It</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fab fa-app-store"></i> Coming Soon-ish</li>                      <li><i class="fab fa-google-play"></i> Coming Soon-ish</li>                                        </ul>                  </div>                </div>              </article>            </div>            <div class="tile is-vertical is-8">              <div class="tile">                <!--                <div class="tile is-parent">                  <article class="tile is-child">                      <iframe width="100%" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkewS_aob0A?rel=0&modestbranding=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>                  </article>                </div>-->              </div>              <div class="tile is-parent">                <article class="tile is-child">                  <div class="content">                  <p>Squawker is a dialogue based game where players talk and guide characters through a process of discovering mental health issues.

The design is minimalist yet playful: exploring physics through touch, objects that react, with high contrast colors, a procedural soundtrack and sound effects that are reminiscent of playing pinball in an arcade.</p>                  </div>                </article>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>        <div id="adpatrol" class="detail" style="display:none;">          <div class="tile is-ancestor">            <div class="tile is-vertical">              <div class="tile">                                <div class="tile is-parent">                  <article class="tile is-child">                    <p class="title">Ad Patrol</p>                      <iframe title="Ad Patrol Preview" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/67908189?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="100%" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>                    </article>                </div>              </div>              <div class="tile is-parent">                <article class="tile is-child">                  <div class="content">                  <p>As a former resident of New York City, seeing advertisements plastered on anything and everything was an everyday experience for me. In 2012, I worked with Jason Eppink and Jordan Seiler to create a game that could crowdsource the reporting of illegal advertisements. While creating a database of illegal advertising in the city was interesting, I also saw an opportunity to use existing datasets to create civic oriented games.</p>                  <p>I imported the existing building permit data from the NYC Department of Buildings into a database. From that point, I created a simple application programming interface (API) that allowed us to supplement the data with new reports that included timestamps, GPS coordinates, a photo, and company name. This new dataset allowed us to map existing legal advertising spaces as well as document places where ads existed but had no data. On top of the API, I designed a simple time-based territorial acquisition game where a player could claim a location by taking a photo. After 24 hours, that new location could be captured by other players by taking another picture. By playing the game, a large group of players would create a timeline documenting illegal advertising. The game works as a proof of concept, although we never marketed Ad Patrol to bring it to scale.</p>                  </div>                </article>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>        <div id="atlantis" class="detail" style="display:none;">          <div class="tile is-ancestor">            <div class="tile is-parent">              <article class="tile is-child box">                <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Atlantis</p>                  <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Play It</p>                    <ul>                    <li><i class="fas fa-download"></i> <a href="https://claytical.itch.io/atlantis">Get it from itch.io</a></li>                    </ul>                    <p class="title">Awards</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Official IndieCade Big Game Selection, 2014</li>                    </ul>                                        <p class="title">Exhibitions</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i> Massively Multiplayer Games... in Person!

Through a series of collaborative and competitive mini games, players experience of the collapse of a city and will of its its inhabitants to survive. Together, by tapping, swiping, and yelling, the audience will decide the conclusion of a civilization in a unique co-operative gaming experience.</p>                  <p>LAN Parties were frequent during my teenage years. My friends and I would lug our desktop computers to one house, setup a router, and play games like Doom and Warcraft late into the night. As networks became faster, large-scale multiplayer games became a strangely solitary experience. You were surrounded by other people but only virtually. As local multiplayer games like Sportsfriends have proven, there is something special about playing games together in a physical space. With Atlantis, my goal was to create the local multiplayer experience at a very large scale. Movie theaters provide a perfect physical location for this to happen.</p>                  <p>As smartphones become more and more ubiquitous, they provide the perfect option for a universal controller. With a team of students, I developed a mobile application for both Apple and Android devices that relies on a set of standardized Open Sound Control (OSC) messages and an OSX game server that is projected on the theater screen. The theater only requires a PC and a wireless network. With their phones connected to the same wireless network, players now have their own game controller that can communicate with the game server. Sharing a large screen with up to 200 people is an interesting design problem. To explore this, we have created multiple mini-game prototypes to see how different systems to work.</p>                  <p>Our first prototype, Sea Nibbles, is the most straightforward. In the game, everyone has their own avatar that they can move around the screen to collect plankton. The players are assigned one of ten different shapes with a random color. Our second prototype, Tanks, pushes the number of people upward by combining functionality of each avatar into separate roles. A set of three players is assigned to a given tank. One person drives, another aims the cannon, and the third person controls the shooting. We re-skinned the mini games into a 3 part game about the destruction of an underwater civilization titled Atlantis.</p>                  </div>                </article>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>        <div id="bumpin" class="detail" style="display:none;">          <div class="tile is-ancestor">            <div class="tile is-vertical">              <div class="tile">                                <div class="tile is-parent">                  <article class="tile is-child">                    <p class="title">Bumpin</p>                    <div  class="fullwidth-video">                      <iframe frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen src="https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xkq1e8" allow="autoplay"></iframe>                    </div>                  </article>                </div>              </div>              <div class="tile is-parent">                <article class="tile is-child">                  <div class="content">                  <p>Bumpin' is a physics based puzzle game where players draw lines in order to guide a ball around the screen. Players receive points for destroying certain bumper types while avoiding hazardous obstacles.

It is meant to be played for a few minutes in any given play session while being addictive enough to draw the player back time and again with new challenges. Bumpin has a mix of procedurally generated and hand crafted levels to explore flexibility in level design and engagement at different tempos.</p>                  <p>Bumpin' was built in an older version of openFrameworks and the iOS SDK and ha since been removed from the App Store for compatibility purposes.

This team was comprised of myself, Dr. Nicholas Carcioppolo, Lien Tran, Dr. Katharina Lang, and David Beyea. The preliminary results of the study were inconclusive yet promising. The mean score for tanning intentions was marginally significantly lower (t(59) = -1.74; p = .09; equal variances not assumed) in the Vanity condition than the control condition, suggesting that Vanity may be an acceptable preventative tool to keep people from engaging in tanning behavior that could lead to skin cancer.</p>                  </div>                </article>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>        <div id="tasaf" class="detail" style="display:none;">          <div class="tile is-ancestor">            <div class="tile is-parent">              <article class="tile is-child box">                <div class="content">                  <p class="title">Uwezeshaji Kaya Kuhimili</p>                  <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Publications</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i> <a href="http://www.climatecentre.org/downloads/files/Games/CDKNGamesReport.pdf">Using games to experience climate risk</a></li>                      <li><i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i> <a href="http://www.bu.edu/pardee/publications-library/2012-archive-2/games-climate-task-force/">Games for a New Climate</a></li>                    </ul>                  </div>                </div>              </article>            </div>            <div class="tile is-vertical is-8">              <div class="tile">                                <div class="tile is-parent">                  <article class="tile is-child">                     <div  class="fullwidth-video">                    <img src="images/projects/vanity/1.JPG">                    </div>                  </article>                </div>              </div>              <div class="tile is-parent">                <article class="tile is-child">                  <div class="content">                        <p>The World Bank commissioned the design of Uwezeshaji kaya kuhimili (which translates as enabling households to withstand), a tabletop game simulating a real-world, Bank-funded development program, with the goal of synthesizing knowledge about the program’s social protection impact for managing climate-related risks. The original prototype was designed for Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) management staff to better understand the program, and this lead to the adaptation of the game to explain the program to rural Tanzanian farmers.</p>                  <p>As a consultant for the World Bank, I was hired as part of an international interdisciplinary team of social scientists, climate experts, and humanitarian workers to design a facilitated game modeled after the Tanzania’s Productive Social Safety Net Program (PSSN). The program is a welfare system approved by the Bank Board in 2012 and implemented by its partner Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) at the national level in Tanzania. To our knowledge, this was the first time a game has been used at this scale in a development program and I was grateful to be part of it. The game was very well received by the World Bank, an our team received an internal Knowlympics award for innovation. An updated version was commissioned by the World Bank and piloted in a few villages led by my colleague Lien Tran. The locals that were part of the pilot enjoyed the experience and it’s my hope that a national roll out will happen eventually.</p>                  </div>                </article>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>        <div id="dreamy" class="detail" style="display:none;">          <div class="tile is-ancestor">            <div class="tile is-parent">              <article class="tile is-child box">                <div class="content">                  <p class="title">Dreamy</p>                  <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Conferences</p>                    <ul>                    <li><i class="far fa-bookmark"></i> Paper presented at KCHC, 2018</li>                    </ul>                    <p class="title">Exhibitions</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="far fa-bookmark"></i> Meaningful Play, 2016</li>                    </ul>                </div>              </article>            </div>            <div class="tile is-vertical is-8">              <div class="tile">                                <div class="tile is-parent">                  <article class="tile is-child">                    <div class="slick">                      <div>                        <img src="images/projects/dreamy/1.png">                      </div>                      <div>                        <img src="images/projects/dreamy/2.png">                      </div>                      <div>                        <img src="images/projects/dreamy/3.png">                      </div>                      <div>                        <img src="images/projects/dreamy/4.png">                      </div>                    </div>                              </article>                </div>              </div>              <div class="tile is-parent">                <article class="tile is-child">                  <div class="content">                        <p>Dreamy is a dating simulator that places the player into conversations with potential suitors where physical appearance matters. The objective of the game is to find a date during a 30 day trial of a dating service. The central game mechanic in the game is choosing how to respond to potential suitors. These conversations highlight the choices and reasons for risk-taking behavior associated with indoor tanning. Components and content in Dreamy are based upon two behavioral prediction models: Integrated Model of Behavioral Prediction (IM: Fishbein, 2000, 2007; Fishbein &amp; Yzer, 2003) and the health belief model (HBM: Rosenstock, 1974; Rosenstock, Strecher &amp; Becker, 1988). The game mechanics have been designed to target salient beliefs and attitudes to determine behavioral intention to engage in tanning behavior and discourage indoor tanning.</p>                  <p>Dreamy is the first game I have designed from the ground up with a researcher to incorporate behavioral prediction models into the core mechanics. Using the integrated model of behavioral prediction and the health belief model, we set out to create a game that targeted salient beliefs and discouraged indoor tanning. I worked with my colleague in the School of Communication, Dr. Soyoon Kim, who created the logic flows of the models in the game. Our preliminary findings were presented at Meaningful Play, which have shown that with our target audience of women age 18-25, the game has an extremely positive effect on changing attitudes about indoor tanning. Further analysis is underway with an expectation for multiple publications based on the extensive data we collected. We plan to release the game on multiple platforms when we have fully verified the effectiveness of the game.</p>                <p>The inherently interdisciplinary nature of games brings scholars from various fields together, so assessing impact can become a contentious issue. In order to move the field forward, some games need to be designed and studied using theoretical frameworks so that we know what works and what doesn’t. Dreamy is my first attempt at this design method and I hope to continue this line of research with other games.</p>                  </div>                </article>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>        <div id="hhc" class="detail" style="display:none;">          <div class="tile is-ancestor">            <div class="tile is-parent">              <article class="tile is-child box">                <div class="content">                  <p class="title">Hustlin' Health Care</p>                  <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Play It</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fas fa-dice"></i> <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/hustlin-health-care">Buy it at GameCrafter</a></li>                    </ul>                    <p class="title">Conferences</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="far fa-bookmark"></i> h+digital @ MIT 2010</li>                      <li><i class="far fa-bookmark"></i> EduLearn, Barcelona 2010</li>                    </ul>                    <p class="title">Press</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="far fa-newspaper"></i> <a href="https://consumerist.com/2010/05/12/hustlin-healthcare-the-board-game/">Hustlin Healthcare: The Board Game</a></li>                    </ul>                  </div>                </div>              </article>            </div>            <div class="tile is-vertical is-8">              <div class="tile">                                <div class="tile is-parent">                  <article class="tile is-child">                    <div  class="fullwidth-video">                      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/11562465?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>                    </div>                  </article>                </div>              </div>              <div class="tile is-parent">                <article class="tile is-child">                  <div class="content">                    <p>Hustling Health Care is a strategic board game that uses real world insurance claim price data. The game aims to teach players the actual cost of health care in the United States through play. Each player takes on the role of an insurance company. They play the game by selling plans to patients and paying claims. The players try to avoid bankruptcy while keeping their patients happy and healthy. Knowing what claims have been paid for and how much each person paid for them gives players an advantage, so the better the player is at the game, the more informed they are as a health care consumer.</p>                  </div>                </article>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>        <div id="hvm" class="detail" style="display:none;">          <div class="tile is-ancestor">            <div class="tile is-parent">              <article class="tile is-child box">                <div class="content">                  <p class="title">Humans vs. Mosquitoes</p>                  <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Press</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="far fa-newspaper"></i> <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/blog/2014/03/21/come-out-play-games-for-change-festival-2014/">Games for Change 2014 Blog</a></li>                      <li><i class="far fa-newspaper"></i> <a href="http://news.trust.org//item/?map=can-a-game-combat-malaria/">Can a Game Combat Malaria?</a></li>                      <li><i class="far fa-newspaper"></i> <a href="http://www.supernews.co.za/humans-pests-face-off/">Humans vs. Mosquitoes Game Best Form of Prevention</li>                    </ul>                    <p class="title">Use Cases</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="far fa-newspaper"></i> <a href="http://www.climatecentre.org/downloads/files/Games/CDKNGamesReport.pdf">Using Games to Experience Climate Risk</a></li>                      <li><i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UwFxNza8ac">Sin Mosquito, No Hay Dengue</a></li>                      <li><i class="fas fa-book"></i> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=rsXMCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA253&lpg=PA253&dq=Serious+Games,+Health,+and+Organizing+harrison&source=bl&ots=hSCKr-DEsZ&sig=TBOa1OqO2_S51-FFhQOFWD-OkZE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiT57LOs6nbAhXS6lMKHSyPDegQ6AEIRDAD#v=onepage&q=Serious%20Games%2C%20Health%2C%20and%20Organizing%20harrison&f=false">Serious Games, Health, and Organizing</a></li>                    </ul>                    <p class="title">Exhibitions</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="far fa-bookmark"></i> Come Out and Play (NYC, SF)</li>                      <li><i class="far fa-bookmark"></i> Come Out and Play SOMArts</li>                      <li><i class="far fa-bookmark"></i> DC Games</li>                      <li><i class="far fa-bookmark"></i> Meaningful Play 2014</li>                      <li><i class="far fa-bookmark"></i> World Health Day at University of Miami</li>                    </ul>                  </div>                </div>              </article>            </div>            <div class="tile is-vertical is-8">              <div class="tile">                                <div class="tile is-parent">                  <article class="tile is-child">                    <div  class="fullwidth-video">                      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/48891646?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>                    </div>                  </article>                </div>              </div>              <div class="tile is-parent">                <article class="tile is-child">                  <div class="content">                    <p>Humans vs. Mosquitoes is a simple non-digital game for social impact that educates players about the relationship between humans, mosquitoes, vector-borne diseases and the environment. Originally designed in 2011, the game has been used by facilitators in at least 4 continents as a fun and engaging way to teach audiences about vector-borne diseases. The game has been modified and adapted to work in various geographic regions as well as with different audiences. Humans vs. Mosquitoes can be played as an active physical play-based game, a thoughtful card game, and even with nothing but a set of instructions and a set of gestures.</p>                  <p>The game has been referenced in several publications, which highlight the academic value of participatory games in humanitarian work around the world.

I won first and second place.</p>                  </div>                </article>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>        <div id="queso" class="detail" style="display:none;">          <div class="tile is-ancestor">            <div class="tile is-parent">              <article class="tile is-child box">                <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Queso</p>                                    <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Try It</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> <a href="https://queso.nerdlab.miami">Website</a></li>                    </ul>                    <!--                    <p class="title">Articles</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="far fa-newspaper"></i> <a href="https://news.miami.edu/stories/2015/05/nerdlab-game-is-unsavory.html">NERDLab Game is Unsavory</a></li>                      <li><i class="far fa-newspaper"></i> <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/education/article31348037.html">In South Florida, rethinking the computer game as a teaching tool</a></li>                      <li><i class="far fa-newspaper"></i> <a href="https://miami.eater.com/2015/4/28/8509535/miami-created-video-game-shows-what-it-is-like-to-work-in-the">Miami Created Video Game Shows What It Is Like To Work in the Restaurant Industry While Sick</a></li>                    </ul>                                        -->                    <p class="title">Awards</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Award of Distinction, Communicator Awards</li>                      <li><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Silver Award, Horizon Interactive Awards</li>                      <li><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Finalist, Reporting Solution, EdTech Digest Awards</li>                    </ul>                    <p class="title">Presentations</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i> Queso: Introducing Game Design Principles into Education, SITE 2017</li>                    </ul>                  </div>                </div>              </article>            </div>            <div class="tile is-vertical is-8">              <div class="tile">                                <div class="tile is-parent">                  <article class="tile is-child">                    <div style="padding:57.81% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/63520492?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>                  </article>                </div>              </div>              <div class="tile is-parent">                <article class="tile is-child">                  <div class="content">                  <p>Queso is an award winning open source web based gameful learning management system. Using principles found in game design, the software seeks to create a simple and engaging experience for students and teachers.</p>                  <p>The market for learning management systems is dominated by Blackboard. While Blackboard is rich in features, the ability for an average user to find and leverage them is low. When it comes to teaching a gameful classroom, existing software suites could be customized by instructors to get the job done but it’s not a small task. Furthermore, instructors that decide to experiment with gamification are often presented with solutions that promote badge systems and leaderboards as the miracle solution for increasing engagement. For me, Queso is a design research process where I could distill ideas from my own gameful experiments in the classroom into solutions for other educators.</p>                  </div>                </article>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>        <div id="per" class="detail" style="display:none;">          <div class="tile is-ancestor">            <div class="tile is-parent">              <article class="tile is-child box">                <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Personal Exposure Reporter</p>                                    <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Use It</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> <a href="https://per.miami.edu">Website</a>                      <li><i class="fab fa-app-store"></i> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/personal-exposure-reporter/id1469614959">Get it on the App Store</a></li>                      <li><i class="fab fa-google-play"></i> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Merge.Miami.Per.Android&hl=en_US&gl=US">Get it on Google Play</a></li>                                        </ul>                  </div>                </div>              </article>            </div>            <div class="tile is-vertical is-8">              <div class="tile">                                <div class="tile is-parent">                  <article class="tile is-child">                      <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/239743546?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>                  </article>                </div>              </div>              <div class="tile is-parent">                <article class="tile is-child">                  <div class="content">                    <p>The Personal Exposure Reporter is a web based application that allows firefighters to keep a digital record of each incident they respond to. Other systems exist for reporting, but their focus is broadly on health and not specific to cancer. After extensive user research, the app will be ableto capture variables of on-the-job exposures that can be used by researchers to find evidence of cancer related to firefighters. The reporter is one of many projects funded through the Firefighter Cancer Initiative (FCI) headed by Dr. Erin Kobetz and funded by the state of Florida. FCI is a large scale interdisciplinary project that includes teams across the University including the Miller School of Medicine, School of Education and Human Development, College of Arts and Sciences, and the School of Communication. My hope, which is shared by the team, is that this project will provide an overwhelming amount of evidence to push Florida legislators to pass a presumptive cancer law.                  </div>                </article>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>        <div id="scan360" class="detail" style="display:none;">          <div class="tile is-ancestor">            <div class="tile is-parent">              <article class="tile is-child box">                <div class="content">                    <p class="title">SCAN 360</p>                                    <div class="content">                    <p class="title">Use It</p>                    <ul>                      <li><i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> <a href="https://scan360.com">Website</a>                    </ul>                  </div>                </div>              </article>            </div>            <div class="tile is-vertical is-8">              <!--              <div class="tile">                                <div class="tile is-parent">                  <article class="tile is-child">                      <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/239743546?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>                  </article>                </div>              </div>            -->              <div class="tile is-parent">                <article class="tile is-child">                  <div class="content">                    <p>SCAN 360 is an interactive platform that describes the burden of cancer throughout the state of Florida, with an emphasis on Sylvester’s catchment area.

I designed and developed the painting software and Zeven created the hardware interface.
