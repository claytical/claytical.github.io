Unlike traditional LMS platforms that can feel rigid and uninspiring, Queso offers a flexible, engaging experience for students and instructors alike. By embedding core game mechanics into course administration, Queso fosters a dynamic learning environment that encourages participation and motivation.</p><h3>Project Significance</h3><p>The development of Queso began in 2012 during my early tenure at the University of Miami. Inspired by a workshop at the Games + Learning + Society (GLS) conference, I recognized the challenges educators faced when trying to implement gameful teaching practices. Existing LMS solutions were either difficult to customize or limited to superficial gamification features like badges and leaderboards. This gap inspired me to create Queso, a system designed to bridge the administrative and motivational needs of instructors who wanted to use gameful methods without overwhelming technical complexity.</p><p>Though Queso was not widely adopted in classrooms, it found use in my own teaching practice and by a few K-12 educators who valued its gameful approach. This limited use highlighted a key reality: most schools rely on enterprise LMS platforms that provide full support for both students and teachers, making the continued development of a niche system like Queso a significant challenge without full-time commitment. Nevertheless, the project remains a significant touchpoint in my exploration of how educational technology can enhance student engagement.</p><h3>Impact on Pedagogical Design</h3><p>While Queso did not see widespread adoption, its design and development offered deep insights into the interaction between students, teachers, and educational tools. This experience profoundly influenced how I design courses, emphasizing the importance of choice, agency, and feedback. My work on Queso allowed me to rethink traditional educational structures, integrating elements of game design to foster a more participatory and motivating classroom environment.</p><p>The principles developed through Queso carried over into other aspects of my design practice, inspiring further exploration into how game mechanics can be applied to learning, community building, and user engagement.</p><h3>Recognition and Contributions</h3><p>Queso was recognized for its innovative approach, earning accolades such as a finalist spot in the 2014 EdTech Digest Awards and silver in the Horizon Interactive Awards. My work on this project also led to invitations to present at conferences, such as the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education, and contributions to publications like New Media and Digital Pedagogy.</p><h3>Reflections and Future Considerations</h3><p>The journey of Queso reinforced the complexity of educational technology and the challenges of adoption in systems dominated by enterprise solutions. However, the lessons learned from this project have been invaluable in shaping my approach to course design, emphasizing how to integrate game mechanics to foster deeper student engagement and participation. While continued development of Queso itself was not feasible, its legacy lives on in the ways I think about and apply gameful design principles across other projects and teaching practices.</p><h3>Thematic Connections</h3><h4>Keep Your Edge</h4><p>As an educational tool, Keep Your Edge complements Queso’s mission of interactive learning. I developed it to serve as a template for students exploring game design, mirroring the teaching-centric approach seen in Queso. Both projects demonstrate my commitment to providing resources that enhance educational experiences.</p><h4>Spreng Easel</h4><p>Developing Spreng Easel for an interactive museum installation aligns with Queso’s goal of enhancing learning through interactive tools. Both projects highlight my role in designing user-friendly interfaces that promote engagement, creativity, and exploration.</p></div></article></div></main><footer class="mt-20 px-10 py-8 bg-slate-200"><div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto text-slate-700 text-center">© 2024 <a href="/" class="font-medium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clay Ewing</a></div></footer><script src="/assets/js/bundle.js"></script></body></html>
