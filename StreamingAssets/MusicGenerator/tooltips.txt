If melody has 100% chord chance, it will always play a full chord."]},

A value of 16 will play the entire measure (16 notes) before moving to the next chord in the progression. This changes the overall feel of things quite a bit."]},

TO NOTE, at least one in each category is required to be unselected.  If you want to exclude the entirety of a category, just lower its odds of playing to zero instead.

If you plan on loading new configurations mid-level and have smaller ram requirements, this is the smoother option for framerates but will take longer to load. Otherwise, load the config at level or app start (if you have plenty of memory overhead, feel free to pre-load instruments for multiple configurations by using MusicGenerator.LoadBaseClips() for each instrument you'll need during the level. This drastically cuts down the time to switch songs, at the expense of longer load times to load in the music assets and the memory needed for them. This is used more for testing in the music editor here than ensuring this config will load asynchronously. Set via code before loading if you want async loading in your app."]},
