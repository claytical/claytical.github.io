            <h2>Capstone</h2>
<p>One of the primary courses I teach is a graduate capstone class for interactive media, structured as a comprehensive two-semester experience. As the primary advisor, I guide each student from initial concept development through to production, encouraging them to push creative boundaries while refining their project scope. During the first semester, we work together to develop, iterate, and solidify their project proposals, focusing on achievable, impactful goals for a 15-week production timeline. Throughout production, I provide continuous mentorship—offering technical guidance, constructive feedback, and scope adjustments to showcase each student’s unique strengths. This journey enables students to create polished, meaningful projects that reflect their skills and aspirations.</p>
<p>The projects I've selected here showcase students who fully engaged with the capstone process, responding thoughtfully to feedback and exploring their ideas to their fullest potential. Their commitment to pushing creative boundaries resulted in projects that reflect both their talent and growth throughout the their time at the university.</p>

<h2>Dogs at Work / Designing Games for Impact</h2>
<p>In Designing Games for Impact, students engage in rapid prototyping through a series of focused 4-week sprints, emphasizing how games can create meaningful social connections and address real-world issues.</p>
<p>For one sprint, students engaged with illustrations from Dogs at Work: Good Dogs. Real Jobs., written by Margaret Cardillo and illustrated by Zachariah OHora. This collaboration allowed students to use the book’s artwork as a foundation, providing both a creative constraint and an equal footing for those less experienced in visual design.</p>
<p>Margaret Cardillo introduced the project’s design brief, giving students an inside look at her story world, yet leaving them free to explore diverse directions for their games. Some students chose themes around purpose and community, while others took unique creative liberties to shape their own narratives. At the project’s conclusion, Margaret Cardillo reviewed each prototype, offering feedback and celebrating the students’ distinct interpretations.</p>
<p>This project highlighted the versatility of storytelling in game design and the ways a consistent visual style can support varied gameplay experiences.</p>
<h3>Design Process Example</h3>
<p>Mia set out to design a game that would teach kids the importance of treating service dogs appropriately. Starting with a board game for multiple players and inspired by Candy Land, playtesting revealed that the first prototype was too complex, especially for young children.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/mia-1.jpg" alt="First Prototype" title="First Prototype"></p>
<p>In the second iteration, the board was removed from the game with a focus on the core game mechanic: whispering when a service dog was drawn from a deck of cards.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/mia-2.jpg" alt="Second Prototype" title="Second Prototype"></p>
<p>In the final iteration, the game has a leader and a player. The leader starts a timer and the player goes through the shuffled deck as quickly as possible while whispering each time a service dog is pulled.</p>
