                  <p>Improving Quality of Urban Water Service by Engaging SMS Technology (IQUEST), is an open-source tool and geographic decision support system that harnesses crowdsourced water data for monitoring residential water service quality by Ghana Water Company Ltd (GWCL). IQUEST provides the ability for water customers to submit water quality reports to GWCL via SMS and then parses the coded text submission into a database. A management dashboard then aggregates this water quality data across all reporting areas as well as for a specific neighborhood.</p>
                  <p>Many developing nations face drinking water shortages, and municipal water rationing has become increasingly common in large urban centers. In Accra, Ghana, this has led to substantial variation in service levels among residential customers at a geographic scale that is too fine to be captured by top-down water service reports issued by local Water Districts. Analog household surveys that collect basic water service metrics have demonstrated the potential to better inform service providers, but they are increasingly cost-prohibitive to implement in a resource constrained setting.</p>
