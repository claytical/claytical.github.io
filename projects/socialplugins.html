                  <p>In 2013 Apple released Social Framework, a software library that allowed developers to easily integrate features such as emailing, tweeting, and posting to Facebook from a mobile application. To use the framework, a developer had to use Objective C, the native language for building iOS applications. However, there are a lot of other solutions that allow developers to create iOS applications. For those developers, accessing the Social Framework from their applications requires writing a bit of code called a plugin that translates from their chosen language and Objective C. Writing a plugin and releasing it to other developers to freely use is part of being a member of the open source community. As someone who builds rapid prototypes, the work that I do would not be possible without a thriving open source community that shares code freely.</p>

                  <p>While working on the Diners Guide for ROC United, I wrote an open source plugin for Cordova that accesses the Social Framework. Cordova is a platform that allows developers to write iOS applications in JavaScript and HTML instead of Objective C. I also converted this code into a plugin for openFrameworks, a C++ library for artists and designers.
