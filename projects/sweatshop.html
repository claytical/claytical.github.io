                  <p>Brutal sewing at itâ€™s finest! Sweatshop Superstar is a bloody rhythm action game in the vein of Guitar Hero. After being sold to Mr. Enojado by his mother, Pepe starts work in a factory. Players guide Pepe, an 8 year old boy with a heart of gold and the fingers of an arthritic corpse through 25 seams of 5 different garments!</p>

                  <p>Sweatshop Superstar was submitted to the App Store in 2009 and promptly rejected. Multiple times. Due to compatibility issues, the game can only be played at the Longwood Art Gallery or on Clay's old iPhone 3GS.</p>
