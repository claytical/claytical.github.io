                  <p>The World Bank commissioned the design of Uwezeshaji kaya kuhimili (which translates as enabling households to withstand), a tabletop game simulating a real-world, Bank-funded development program, with the goal of synthesizing knowledge about the program’s social protection impact for managing climate-related risks. The original prototype was designed for Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) management staff to better understand the program, and this lead to the adaptation of the game to explain the program to rural Tanzanian farmers.</p>
                  <p>As a consultant for the World Bank, I was hired as part of an international interdisciplinary team of social scientists, climate experts, and humanitarian workers to design a facilitated game modeled after the Tanzania’s Productive Social Safety Net Program (PSSN). The program is a welfare system approved by the Bank Board in 2012 and implemented by its partner Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) at the national level in Tanzania. To our knowledge, this was the first time a game has been used at this scale in a development program and I was grateful to be part of it. The game was very well received by the World Bank, an our team received an internal Knowlympics award for innovation. An updated version was commissioned by the World Bank and piloted in a few villages led by my colleague Lien Tran. The locals that were part of the pilot enjoyed the experience and it’s my hope that a national roll out will happen eventually.</p>
