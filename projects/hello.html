I work at the <a href="http://com.miami.edu">University of Miami</a> where I teach in the <a href="http://interactive.miami.edu">Interactive Media Program</a>.

            <p>I currently have a few projects in development...</p>

            <h4 class="subtitle">A Long Way from Home: The Game</h4>
              <p>I'm working with Matthew Jacobson and Gaspar Gonzalez to create an interactive experience based on their documentary <a href="https://longwayfromhomemovie.com/">A Long Way From Home: The Untold Story of Baseball's Desegregation</a>.</p>

            <h4 class="subtitle">Moonlight Flight</h4>
              <p>The spiritual sequel to my first approved game in the App Store, Moonlight Flight is a physics based puzzle game where players draw lines and tilt the device in order to guide a ball around the screen. Players receive points for destroying certain bumper types while avoiding hazardous obstacles. It can be played slowly, devising a set of lines drawn before a ball is dropped or in real time, drawing lines after seeing physical reactions.</p>

<!--            <h4 class="subtitle">Stiltsville VR Experience</h4>
              <p>I'm working with FilmGate Miami on a project that recieved Knight Arts Challenge funding to help Miamians explore iconic Stiltsville. We'll be creating a virtual reality experience that explores homes on stilts in Biscayne Bay.</p>
