            <p>I'm Clay Ewing, a creative technologist and educator. I teach at the <a href="http://com.miami.edu" target="_blank">University of Miami</a> in the <a href="http://interactive.miami.edu" target="_blank">Interactive Media Program</a>. I'm the Co-Director of <a href="http://nerdlab.miami" target="_blank">NERDLab</a>, where I work with students, researchers and creative professionals to design and develop social impact games and applications. My work has received numerous awards from organizations such as the Serious Games Showcase, International Serious Play Awards, Broadcast Education Association (BEA), Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC) and the Appys. The games I've worked on have been exhibited at awesome conferences and festivals such as IndieCade, Meaningful Play, the International Symposium on Electronic Art (ISEA) and Come Out and Play.</p>

            <p>My focus as of late has turned towards creating high quality evidence-based games. If you attended Games for Change in 2018, you may have seen my talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8Q4WnkF3A8" target="_blank">Hypothesis Tested: Designing Social Impact Games with Theoretical Frameworks</a> where I discuss the design, development and evaluation of <a href="#dreamy" class="content-link">Dreamy</a>, an online dating simulator that seeks to change the player's intention to tan. A manuscript is under review. Based on the initial findings, we're using what we learned to tackle anxiety and depression in college students.

            <div class="medium title">What are you doing now?</div>            
            <p>I have just finished a pandemic edition of <a href="#unsavory" class="content-link">Unsavory</a>, to take a deeper look at the government response and the life of a restaurant worker deemed essential. It will be available soon <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.nerdlab.miami">here</a>. It will not be available for iOS as the beta was rejected by Apple as inappropriate (according to Apple, games are for entertainment only).</p>

            <p>NERDLab also launched a new update to a hypercasual game called Moonlight Flight. It's not a social impact game. The game is a combination of two passions of mine: producing music and making games. The game features a procedural composition that shifts based on your progress and energy level. It's available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.nerdlab.moonlightflight">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1497233635">iOS</a>.</p>

            <p>Last but not least, I'm working on turning my course on Internet, Media and Society into a podcast. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/clay-ewing-766614148">Follow me on SoundCloud</a> if you're interested.</p>
