              <p>As a means of connecting with the local game development community, I have been an active participant in the Global Game Jam, a hackathon where teams work together to make a game in 48 hours. In 2014, the Global Game Jam happened to coincide with the month long Candy Jam against the trademark practices of King.com. Our team decided to create a game that matched themes for both events by creating Extreme Candy Photo Bomb Scavenger Memory Saga.</p>
              <p>In the game, the player shoots candy out of a wand. When the candy hits a matching candy, it disappears along with any other connected matching candy. Our twist on this familiar match 3 game mechanic was to use a camera to generate levels. Before the level begins, the player takes a picture. The starting candy is placed based on the color values in each pixel of the photo taken by the player. By the end of the jam, we had a fully functional prototype that I developed in openFrameworks. It won both awards "Best Game" and "Best Candy Game") at our site location. We submitted the game to the App Store to get into the spirit of the Candy Jam and troll King.com a bit, however the game was rejected by Apple as the words we used in the title were trademarked.</p>
