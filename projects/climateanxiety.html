                  <p>In 2014, I was invited by TribecaHacks to CERN in Meyrin, Switzerland to create new forms of storytelling over the course of five days in an event called Story Matter. Teams were composed of scientists, storytellers, designers, and technologists. On my team, I served as the technologist, building the software that would run our project.</p>

                  <p>The experience is composed of scenes. Each scene has 3 thoughts. Thoughts are composed of a line of text and an image, which relates to one of the three characters. While the scene plays, the brainwave activity is constantly monitored. The software calculates the attention given to each thought during a scene and advances to the next scene that is dynamically created based on the highest ranked thought.</p>

                  <p>In addition to exhibiting at the CineGlobe Film Festival, our group was invited by the Tribeca Film Institute (TFI) to show our project at the TFI Interactive Playground, a new addition to the Tribeca Film Festival that explores storytelling with new media. I took the opportunity to dive deeper into the code I developed and built an open source platform so that the foundation could be reused by anyone. I ended up working with Ed Talavera to produce another story using video for the UM Interactive Showcase at FilmGate Interactive in 2016.</p>
