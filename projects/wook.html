                  <p>One of my first forays into interactive storytelling was working with Ed Talavera’s graduate cinematography class to produce Screamisodes, a horror story/event for Halloween at the University of Miami. After discussing potential ideas for incorporating mobile phones into a film project, we decided that using QR codes would provide the most flexibility for students with a wide range of mobile devices. Students were responsible for shooting a series of scenes with potential actions. The actions provided a visual clue where to find the next QR code. After following the correct path, the audience would end up at the final scene location where the producers were waiting with a prize.</p>

                  <p>I developed a rapid prototype that allowed the students to construct these branching narratives with videos from Vimeo. The students from Ed’s class expressed an interest in using the same technique for other projects. I like building tools that can be re-used, so I modified the software to act as a platform that allows multiple projects per user. It was named Wook, as the combination of walking and looking around.</p>
