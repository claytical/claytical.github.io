                  <p>I have always found the interaction model with mirrors fascinating. When you stare into one, you become conscious of your appearance. You can’t see yourself as other people do because you’re in a state of constant reaction. I created a digital mirror to erase this unintended consciousness by delaying what is shown by different amounts of time. The original prototype was created with a webcam attached to a Mac mini with a piece of custom software written in openFrameworks. It was accepted, exhibited and awarded an honorable mention at the International Digital Media and Arts Association (IDMAA) IDEAS_2013 Art Exhibit at the Laguna College of Art + Design. It was also shown at the 2014 International Symposium of Electronic Art (ISEA) exhibition in Dubai.</p>
