                  <p>Don Grey Cafe is an endless tea pouring game that was initially conceived at the 2016 Global Game Jam. In the game, you serve different types of tea to customers based on their shirt color. We decided to highlight a local Miami startup, Lemon City Tea, as a way of exploring games for advertising purposes. The original game was developed in less than 48 hours. When the game jam concluded, we polished the game a bit more so we could release it on Google Play.</p>
