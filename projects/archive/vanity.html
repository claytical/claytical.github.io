                  <p>Vanity is a tabletop game designed to reduce the intent to use tanning beds and prevent melanoma in adolescents and young adults. The game was funded by the Division of Dermatology at the Ottawa Hospital and the University of Ottawa. It is the precursor to my more recent digital game Dreamy.</p>
                  <p>In 2014, a team of UM School of Communication researchers conducted a pilot study on the efficacy of Vanity as a public health intervention promoting indoor tanning avoidance. This team was comprised of myself, Dr. Nicholas Carcioppolo, Lien Tran, Dr. Katharina Lang, and David Beyea. The preliminary results of the study were inconclusive yet promising. The mean score for tanning intentions was marginally significantly lower (t(59) = -1.74; p = .09; equal variances not assumed) in the Vanity condition than the control condition, suggesting that Vanity may be an acceptable preventative tool to keep people from engaging in tanning behavior that could lead to skin cancer.</p>
