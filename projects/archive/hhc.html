                  <p>Hustling Health Care is a strategic board game that uses real world insurance claim price data. The game aims to teach players the actual cost of health care in the United States through play. Each player takes on the role of an insurance company. They play the game by selling plans to patients and paying claims. The players try to avoid bankruptcy while keeping their patients happy and healthy. Knowing what claims have been paid for and how much each person paid for them gives players an advantage, so the better the player is at the game, the more informed they are as a health care consumer.</p>
