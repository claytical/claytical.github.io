                  <p>Brutal sewing at itâ€™s finest! <i>Sweatshop Superstar</i> is a bloody rhythm action game in the vein of Guitar Hero. After being sold to Mr. Enojado by his mother, Pepe starts work in a factory. Players guide Pepe, an 8 year old boy with a heart of gold and the fingers of an arthritic corpse through 25 seams of 5 different garments!</p>

                  <p><i>Sweatshop Superstar</i> was submitted to the App Store in 2009 and promptly rejected. Multiple times. Due to compatibility issues, the game can only be played at the Longwood Art Gallery or on Clay's old iPhone 3GS.</p>

                  <p>This game was the first project I worked on after graduating from Parsons. As an aspiring unseasoned programmer, I wrote the entire thing in openFrameworks for iOS. After submitting it to the App Store in 2009, it received a swift rejection. Continued attempts to rectify the situation were shut down consistently. With no quick way to port the game, it faced immediate obsolence.</p>

                  <p>Two years later, Littleloud released <i>Sweatshop</i>, followed shortly by Molleindustria's <i>Phone Story</i>. Those developers were smart enough to program their games in something that could be ported to Android easily. The lesson for me, however, was the power Apple and other platforms censor content that critique their business model.</p>
