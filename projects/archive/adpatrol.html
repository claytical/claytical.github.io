                  <p>As a former resident of New York City, seeing advertisements plastered on anything and everything was an everyday experience for me. In 2012, I worked with Jason Eppink and Jordan Seiler to create a game that could crowdsource the reporting of illegal advertisements. While creating a database of illegal advertising in the city was interesting, I also saw an opportunity to use existing datasets to create civic oriented games.</p>

                  <p>I imported the existing building permit data from the NYC Department of Buildings into a database. From that point, I created a simple application programming interface (API) that allowed us to supplement the data with new reports that included timestamps, GPS coordinates, a photo, and company name. This new dataset allowed us to map existing legal advertising spaces as well as document places where ads existed but had no data. On top of the API, I designed a simple time-based territorial acquisition game where a player could claim a location by taking a photo. After 24 hours, that new location could be captured by other players by taking another picture. By playing the game, a large group of players would create a timeline documenting illegal advertising. The game works as a proof of concept, although we never marketed Ad Patrol to bring it to scale.</p>
