                  <p>Atlantis is a multiplayer local network game experience meant for play by groups in a cinema space through a smartphone controller. Through a series of collaborative and competitive mini games, players experience of the collapse of a city and will of its its inhabitants to survive. Together, by tapping, swiping, and yelling, the audience will decide the conclusion of a civilization in a unique co-operative gaming experience.</p>
                  <p>LAN Parties were frequent during my teenage years. My friends and I would lug our desktop computers to one house, setup a router, and play games like Doom and Warcraft late into the night. As networks became faster, large-scale multiplayer games became a strangely solitary experience. You were surrounded by other people but only virtually. As local multiplayer games like Sportsfriends have proven, there is something special about playing games together in a physical space. With Atlantis, my goal was to create the local multiplayer experience at a very large scale. Movie theaters provide a perfect physical location for this to happen.</p>

                  <p>As smartphones become more and more ubiquitous, they provide the perfect option for a universal controller. With a team of students, I developed a mobile application for both Apple and Android devices that relies on a set of standardized Open Sound Control (OSC) messages and an OSX game server that is projected on the theater screen. The theater only requires a PC and a wireless network. With their phones connected to the same wireless network, players now have their own game controller that can communicate with the game server. Sharing a large screen with up to 200 people is an interesting design problem. To explore this, we have created multiple mini-game prototypes to see how different systems to work.</p>

                  <p>Our first prototype, Sea Nibbles, is the most straightforward. In the game, everyone has their own avatar that they can move around the screen to collect plankton. The players are assigned one of ten different shapes with a random color. Our second prototype, Tanks, pushes the number of people upward by combining functionality of each avatar into separate roles. A set of three players is assigned to a given tank. One person drives, another aims the cannon, and the third person controls the shooting. We re-skinned the mini games into a 3 part game about the destruction of an underwater civilization titled Atlantis.</p>
