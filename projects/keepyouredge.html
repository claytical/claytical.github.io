                  <p>In my creative coding classes, there are always students that are interested in creating games. Programming a game from scratch is a giant task and for a beginner, itâ€™s easy to get lost in trying to figure out a proper design pattern. I developed Keep Your Edge with the intention of students studying it or using it as a base template for their own games. The objects in the code match the elements in the game: enemies, collectibles, and a protagonist. I also built a level editor so that in my game design classes students could practice level design. I also used the level editor as part of a workshop I was invited give as part of the inaugural Geeki Girl Conference for young girls. In both cases, I was able to offer the students a chance to publish their work in the App Store, which was very well received.</p>
