                  <p>Bumpinâ€™ is a physics based puzzle game where players draw lines in order to guide a ball around the screen. Players receive points for destroying certain bumper types while avoiding hazardous obstacles. It can be played slowly, devising a set of lines drawn before a ball is dropped or in real time, drawing lines after seeing physical reactions. It is meant to be played for a few minutes in any given play session while being addictive enough to draw the player back time and again with new challenges. Bumpin has a mix of procedurally generated and hand crafted levels to explore flexibility in level design and engagement at different tempos.</p>

                  <p>Bumpin' was built in an older version of openFrameworks and the iOS SDK and ha since been removed from the App Store for compatibility purposes. Bumpin' 2 will be released soon.</p>
