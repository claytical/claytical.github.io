                  <p>I was comissioned by the Lowe Art Museum to create two pieces for the Spreng: DRESDEN exhibit. The first piece, <strong>Spreng as Artist</strong> is a custom iPad app that shows an interactive timelapse of Sebastian Spreng's process creating six works of digital art. The app puts the video on an endless loop that will pause when touched and allows the user to scrub through the timelapse by dragging their finger.</p>
                  <p>For the second piece, <strong>You as Artist</strong>, I collaborated with Zeven Rodriguez to create a painting application that allows the user to paint on top of images from the Lowe's permanent collection. It contains 17 custom brushes that allow manipulation of size, opacity, and color. The easel mounted to the touchscreen provides the user interface as a series of buttons and knobs.</p>
