                  <p>While participating in BattleHack, a 24 hour hackathon, my team created a game that allowed players to donate money to charities via PayPal. The engineering team at PayPal has written many plugins for many environments that allow software developers to send and receive money through their programs, however openFrameworks wasnâ€™t one of them. Since I was building the game in openFrameworks and needed a way to access PayPal, I wrote a plugin. Just as I did with the Social Framework, I released the plugin as an open source project so that other iOS openFrameworks developers could use PayPal in their applications.</p>
