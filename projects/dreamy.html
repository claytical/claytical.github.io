                  <p>Dreamy is a dating simulator that places the player into conversations with potential suitors where physical appearance matters. The objective of the game is to find a date during a 30 day trial of a dating service. The central game mechanic in the game is choosing how to respond to potential suitors. These conversations highlight the choices and reasons for risk-taking behavior associated with indoor tanning. Components and content in Dreamy are based upon two behavioral prediction models: Integrated Model of Behavioral Prediction (IM: Fishbein, 2000, 2007; Fishbein &amp; Yzer, 2003) and the health belief model (HBM: Rosenstock, 1974; Rosenstock, Strecher &amp; Becker, 1988). The game mechanics have been designed to target salient beliefs and attitudes to determine behavioral intention to engage in tanning behavior and discourage indoor tanning.</p>
                  <p>Dreamy is the first game I have designed from the ground up with a researcher to incorporate behavioral prediction models into the core mechanics. Using the integrated model of behavioral prediction and the health belief model, we set out to create a game that targeted salient beliefs and discouraged indoor tanning. I worked with my colleague in the School of Communication, Dr. Soyoon Kim, who created the logic flows of the models in the game. Our preliminary findings were presented at Meaningful Play, which have shown that with our target audience of women age 18-25, the game has an extremely positive effect on changing attitudes about indoor tanning. Further analysis is underway with an expectation for multiple publications based on the extensive data we collected. We plan to release the game on multiple platforms when we have fully verified the effectiveness of the game.</p>

                <p>The inherently interdisciplinary nature of games brings scholars from various fields together, so assessing impact can become a contentious issue. In order to move the field forward, some games need to be designed and studied using theoretical frameworks so that we know what works and what doesnâ€™t. Dreamy is my first attempt at this design method and I hope to continue this line of research with other games.</p>
