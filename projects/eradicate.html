                  <p>Eradicate! is a single player card game that builds on top of Humans vs. Mosquitoes. In the game, you play as a human in charge of a village where you must defend your people and clear breeding grounds filled with mosquitoes. The game was developed to emphasize learning through a first person, human-centric perspective. Eradicate! teaches about the transmission of disease passed through mosquitoes while also introducing ways to prevent habitat and population proliferation.</p>
