            <p>Bumpin' 2 is a physics based puzzle game where players draw lines in order to guide a ball around the screen. Players receive points for destroying certain bumper types while avoiding hazardous obstacles. It can be played slowly, devising a set of lines drawn before a ball is dropped or in real time, drawing lines after seeing physical reactions.</p>
            <p>Bumpin' 2 is a casual game. It is meant to be played for a few minutes in any given play session while being addictive enough to draw the player back time and again with new challenges. The design is playful: exploring physics through drawing, personified objects that react, bright and vibrant colors, and sounds that are reminiscent of playing pinball in an arcade.</p>
            <p>The prequel had a mix of procedurally generated and hand crafted levels. The procedural nature of level generation reduced the flexibility in level design. This updated version seeks to provide a greater challenge while opening the possibility of level packs being released on a regular basis.</p>
