                  <p>Queso is an award winning open source web based gameful learning management system. Using principles found in game design, the software seeks to create a simple and engaging experience for students and teachers.</p>

                  <p>The market for learning management systems is dominated by Blackboard. While Blackboard is rich in features, the ability for an average user to find and leverage them is low. When it comes to teaching a gameful classroom, existing software suites could be customized by instructors to get the job done but itâ€™s not a small task. Furthermore, instructors that decide to experiment with gamification are often presented with solutions that promote badge systems and leaderboards as the miracle solution for increasing engagement. For me, Queso is a long term design research process where I can distill ideas from my own gameful experiments in the classroom into solutions for other educators.</p>
