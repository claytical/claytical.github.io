                  <p>The Personal Exposure Reporter is a web based application that allows firefighters to keep a digital record of each incident they respond to. Other systems exist for reporting, but their focus is broadly on health and not specific to cancer. After extensive user research, the Personal Exposure Reporter is able to capture variables of on-the-job exposures that can be used by researchers to find evidence of cancer related to firefighters.</p>
                  <p>The data that is collected by the PERIL application will be used by researchers to study the occupational risk of cancer associated with exposure to carcinogens. Our data will have the ability to be linked with the data being collected by other projects within FCI, including the Annual Cancer Survey and the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS) which will give researchers an unprecedented look at cancer risk for firefighters. Our hope is that this project will provide an overwhelming amount of evidence to push Florida legislators to pass a presumptive cancer law.</p>
