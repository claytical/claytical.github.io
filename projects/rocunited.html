                  <p>Every year Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United catalogs wages, benefits, and promotion practices of 150 of the most popular restaurants in America and publishers the Diners’ Guide to Ethical Eating. Using this data, I designed and developed an interactive mobile version of the guide. The interactive version of the guide allows users to search by labor practice preferences and location. Users of the app can join in a social media campaign and tweet to restaurants based on their labor practices. Additionally, users can submit reports of restaurants not on the list to be verified and added by ROC United. In late 2012, I released the first version of the app for both Android and iOS devices. In early 2015, I released a redesigned version of the app that took shifted ROC United’s strategy to crowd sourcing information about restaurants.</p>

                  <p>In order to provide up to date results, I also developed a web interface and database for ROC United that allows the organization to maintain restaurant listings as well as verify crowd sourced reports from users.
