Environment</h2><p>Humans vs. Mosquitoes is an educational game designed to teach players about the relationship between humans, mosquitoes, vector-borne diseases, and the environment. Originally conceived during a two-day workshop at Yale University, the game was designed with dual purposes: a physical schoolyard game for children to play in a field and an abstracted version suitable for diplomats at the COP-17 Conference. This innovative approach allowed for interactive learning both in casual and formal settings, engaging audiences with diverse backgrounds.</p><h3>Project Significance</h3><p>Following the workshop, I collaborated with a smaller group of designers to develop a card game version of Humans vs. Mosquitoes. This version debuted at Come Out and Play as part of SOMA Arts and showcased how the game could adapt from active physical play to a more structured card format. The game’s flexibility has led to its use in educational workshops on four continents, adapting to various geographic and cultural contexts.</p><p>The game’s importance grew as public interest in vector-borne diseases, like Zika, increased in regions such as South Florida. Humans vs. Mosquitoes has been utilized in collaboration with departments at the University of Miami, such as Dr. Ji Shen's lesson at West Laboratory, to educate local children about disease transmission. The game’s unique focus on transmission over specific diseases has made it an effective tool for communicating prevention strategies for a range of vector-borne illnesses.</p><h3>Notable Interventions</h3><p>The game has been featured in significant educational efforts, including initiatives in Panama and Barbados. In Panama, under the guidance of Dr. Sherri Porcelain, students used the game with indigenous communities and discovered that awareness campaigns had not effectively conveyed key information about dengue prevention. The game bridged this gap, highlighting its potential as an impactful teaching tool.</p><p>In Barbados, Humans vs. Mosquitoes was used in the Let’s Adapt Workshop, funded by Games for a Caribbean Climate and supported by the IFRC. The workshop’s participants found the game engaging, leading to discussions on local adaptations for addressing regional health challenges.</p><h3>Expanding the Experience with Eradicate!</h3><p>To build on the success of Humans vs. Mosquitoes, I developed Eradicate!, a single-player card game that places players in the role of a human defending a village from mosquito breeding grounds. This game was designed to offer a human-centric perspective, focusing on the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases and prevention techniques. Eradicate! emphasizes learning through strategic decision-making, teaching players how to manage environmental and health challenges. The game was recognized with a Bronze Award for Games for Good at the International Serious Play Awards in 2019 and was showcased at Meaningful Play in 2018.</p><h3>Legacy and Future Directions</h3><p>Humans vs. Mosquitoes continues to be highlighted in academic publications and humanitarian projects for its participatory and educational value. With the addition of Eradicate! expanding the scope for individual learning, these games exemplify the potential of interactive play to engage communities, enhance understanding, and promote public health.</p><h3>Thematic Connections</h3><h4>IQUEST</h4><p>As part of the development team for IQUEST, I designed user interfaces and data systems that empowered communities to report water quality issues. This aligns with Humans vs. Mosquitoes’ goal of educating communities about public health and environmental risks. The outcome was a prototype that demonstrated the effectiveness of crowd-based data collection, inspiring potential future adaptations.</p><h4>Personal Exposure Reporter</h4><p>I served as the lead of a subproject for the Firefighter Cancer Initiative, creating a tool for tracking health risks, which connects to the educational focus of Humans vs. Mosquitoes. Both projects use interactive design to promote public health and proactive education. The success of Personal Exposure Reporter underscores the potential for these types of tools to scale up and impact public health policy.</p><h4>Climate Anxiety</h4><p>I was the lead technologist for Climate Anxiety, which raised awareness about climate change through interactive storytelling. This project connects to Humans vs. Mosquitoes in its focus on environmental education. It was exhibited at international festivals, showcasing the potential of games to engage users with critical global issues.</p></div></article></div></main><footer class="mt-20 px-10 py-8 bg-slate-200"><div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto text-slate-700 text-center">© 2024 <a href="/" class="font-medium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clay Ewing</a></div></footer><script src="/assets/js/bundle.js"></script></body></html>
