            <h2>An Adventure Game Raising Awareness and Reducing Stigma Around Sickle Cell Disease</h2>
<p>Zoo Rush is a mobile running adventure game that raises awareness, reduces stigma, and fosters empathy for individuals living with sickle cell disease. Players assume the role of a zookeeper with sickle cell disease on their first day at work, tasked with recapturing escaped animals while managing their health. To succeed, players must balance their physical activity by staying hydrated, avoiding infections, checking in with their physician, and managing pain—all while completing their job responsibilities. This unique approach aimed to challenge stereotypes and emphasize that individuals with chronic conditions can lead active, fulfilling lives.</p>
<h3>Project Significance</h3>
<p>Zoo Rush was the first game I produced from start to finish at the University of Miami. It set a benchmark for future projects, emphasizing student-led collaboration and experiential learning. As the lead designer and producer, I assembled and mentored a team that included a student programmer with no prior game development experience. This student’s work on Zoo Rush became an essential portfolio piece that paved the way for her eventual role as programming lead on Pokémon Go, exemplifying the long-term impact of fostering real-world project experience in an academic setting.</p>
<h3>Outcomes and Impact</h3>
<p>While the initial version of Zoo Rush found an audience among younger children due to its approachable art style, the project continues to evolve. Like Don Grey Cafe, I am redesigning it into a local multiplayer experience. The new iteration will focus less on sickle cell disease and more on promoting representation in video games through a diverse cast of selectable characters, aligning with my broader goal of inclusive design.</p>
<p>Zoo Rush received multiple awards, including first place in the AEJMC’s annual Best of Web Competition and a Silver Award at the International Serious Play Awards. It has also served as a platform for developing student talent, leading to real-world career advancements such as the student programmer’s role on Pokémon Go. The game continues to develop into a local multiplayer experience, prioritizing representation and diversity within its character roster. This evolution underscores my belief in the power of interactive media to foster inclusion, awareness, and meaningful player engagement.</p>
<h3>Thematic Connections</h3>
<h4>Personal Exposure Reporter</h4>
<p>The Personal Exposure Reporter is a health-focused application that helped track firefighter exposure to carcinogens. This connection underscores my commitment to creating tools that educate and raise awareness about health management. This app and Zoo Rush utilize interactive technology to engage users with health-related themes, showcasing my ability to balance informative content with user-centric design.</p>
<h4>Humans vs. Mosquitoes</h4>
<p>Co-developing Humans vs. Mosquitoes involved designing a game that educated communities about disease transmission, echoing Zoo Rush’s focus on awareness and learning through play. Both projects exemplify my skill in crafting educational games that resonate with diverse audiences.</p>
<h4>Climate Anxiety</h4>
<p>My work as lead technologist for Climate Anxiety focused on environmental awareness and interactive storytelling, which aligns with Zoo Rush’s aim of engaging players through gameplay that promotes empathy and awareness. This thematic connection highlights my dedication to creating experiences that blend education with entertainment.</p>
